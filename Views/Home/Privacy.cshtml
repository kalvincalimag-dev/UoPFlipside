                <p>At UPang Flipside, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our users to be the masters of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why UPang Flipside ("Flames”, "we”, or "us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our sites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us.</p>
                <p>We collect minimal information that can be used to identify you by default. If you want to just browse, you don't need an account. If you want to create an account to participate in the website, we don't require you to give us your real name. We don't automatically track your precise location. You can share as much or as little about yourself as you want. You can create multiple accounts, update information as you see fit, or ask us to delete your information. </p>
                <p id="infoprotectlinker">Any data we collect is used primarily to provide our services, which are focused on allowing people to come together and form communities, the vast majority of which are public. If you have questions about how we use your data, you can always ask us for more information.</p>

                <div class="text no-counter">
                    <p>We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. <p style="margin:0;" id="rightsandchoiceslinker">We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to nonpublic personal information.<p /></p>
                    <p>We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.<a id="your-choices"></a></p>

                <div class="text no-counter">
                    <p>
                        You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Depending on where you live, you may also have the right to request access to or ability to port, deletion/erasure of, or correction/rectification of, your personal information, to opt out of certain advertising practices, or to withdraw consent for processing where you have previously provided consent. Below we explain how to exercise each of these rights. UPang Flipside does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws.

You can also submit a request to delete the personal information UPang Flipside maintains about you by following the process described below this table. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users. Please note, however, that the comments you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. After you submit a request to delete your account, it may take up to 90 days for our purge script to complete deletion. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.
